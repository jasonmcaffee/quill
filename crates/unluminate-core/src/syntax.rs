//! Reading source code into coloured tokens.
//!
//! It lives here, next to the Markdown parser, for the same reason that one does: it reads text and
//! produces spans over it, it draws nothing, and its tests run with no window, no graphics card and
//! no fonts. Nothing here knows what a colour scheme is either — a [`Token`] is what a stretch of
//! text *is*, and the window decides what colour that is.
//!
//! ## What it does, and what it does not
//!
//! One linear pass, no regular expressions, no dependency. The rules are tried in this order, and
//! the order is the whole design:
//!
//! 1. A line comment runs to the end of the line.
//! 2. A block comment runs to its terminator.
//! 3. A string runs to its matching quote, and a backslash escapes the next character.
//! 4. A number is a run of digits, with an optional decimal point, a hexadecimal prefix, or a
//!    suffix such as `u32` or `px`. A grammar may also ask for `#ff0000` to be one.
//! 5. A word is a keyword, a builtin or a type if it is in one of the grammar's three lists.
//! 6. A word directly followed by `(` is a function; one starting with a capital letter is a type.
//! 7. Anything else is text.
//!
//! Comments and strings win over everything, because a keyword inside a string is not a keyword.
//!
//! Rules 6 is a **heuristic and is meant to be one**. `Promise.all(` colours `all` as a function and
//! `Promise` as a type without Unluminate understanding a single thing about JavaScript, which is what
//! `task-1649` asks for and is what a colouring pass is for. Real understanding is a language
//! server, and that is not what this is.
//!
//! ## What a language may ask for on top of that
//!
//! Three of the fields on a [`Grammar`] are off unless a manifest names them, and all three arrived
//! with `task-1671`'s CSS plugin, which none of the rules above could read at all.
//!
//! [`Grammar::word_characters`] are characters that count as part of a word wherever they appear,
//! including the first position. **A hyphen is a letter in CSS**: nearly every property name has one
//! in it, every custom property starts with two and every vendor prefix is one, so a pass that broke
//! a word at a hyphen could not recognise a single CSS property by name.
//!
//! [`Grammar::types`] is a third list of words beside the keywords and the builtins. Until it
//! existed, [`Token::Type`] was reachable only by the capital letter heuristic, which is silent in a
//! language that does not capitalise. CSS has three kinds of word worth telling apart — the at-rule,
//! the property and the value — and two lists could not.
//!
//! [`Grammar::hex_colors`] makes `#` and three, four, six or eight hexadecimal digits a number,
//! which is CSS's colour grammar exactly. Without it `#00ff00` was a number and `#ff0000` was a
//! word, because [`number`] wants a digit first, so half the colours in a stylesheet were coloured
//! and the other half were not.
//!
//! [`Grammar::export_keyword`] and the eight fields under it are `task-1680`'s, and they are what
//! lets a language say how its **imports** are written: which words begin one, whether the module
//! is a string or a path of segments, what a written module resolves to on the disk, and which
//! segments are reserved. They follow the same rule — a plugin that names none of them has exactly
//! the behaviour it had before, and nothing in Unluminate holds a list of which languages have imports.
//!
//! [`Grammar::markup`] and [`Grammar::raw_text`] are `task-1694`'s, and they are the first two that
//! change the rules rather than adding to them. With `markup` on, [`scan`] runs a five-state machine
//! instead of the seven rules above, because HTML is **prose with code in the tags** where every
//! other language Unluminate reads is code with prose in the comments. Seventy-six HTML element names are
//! also ordinary English words — `body`, `table`, `form`, `main`, `code`, `time`, `small` — so a
//! pass that coloured them wherever it found them would colour a paragraph of English like a
//! stylesheet, and an apostrophe read as a quote would make every contraction yellow to the end of
//! its line. The same rule holds: a language that names neither key is read by exactly the code that
//! read it before.
//!
//! Deliberately not handled, so nobody has to discover it: nested block comments in Rust — the first
//! terminator ends the comment; interpolation inside a template literal, which is coloured as part
//! of the string; JSX, which is text; and regular expression literals, which cannot be told from
//! division without parsing.
