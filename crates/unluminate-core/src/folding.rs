//! What in a file can be collapsed, and what somebody has collapsed.
//!
//! `task-1686` asks for the reference editor's fold arrows: a chevron beside the line number against a function,
//! an `if` or a large block, and a way of putting everything but the passages you have marked out of
//! sight. `tasks/task-1686-folding-tdd.md` records what was weighed; this module is the half of it
//! that has no window in it.
//!
//! Two things live here and they are deliberately separate.
//!
//! [`regions`] reads the text and says what **could** be folded. It is derived from the file and is
//! not state: open the same file twice and it answers the same thing, and every edit makes it answer
//! again. The tier is the one `task-1675` chose for go to definition and `task-1680` chose for
//! imports — a **syntactic reading**, from the same single `syntax::scan` pass that colours the file
//! — because a language server would answer better on the machines that happen to have one and not
//! at all on the rest, and a fold arrow that is silently absent looks like a fault.
//!
//! [`Folds`] is which of them somebody has collapsed, and it is state. It holds **byte offsets**
//! rather than line numbers, so that it can live in the [`crate::document::Document`] and be moved
//! by the two functions that already move the marked passages when the text changes. A set of line
//! numbers would be wrong the moment a line was typed at the top of the file.
